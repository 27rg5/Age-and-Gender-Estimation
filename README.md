# Age-and-Gender-Estimation

Repository for my project, where I **estimate the age and gender of a person using a 128x128 grayscale image**. 

The dataset used was the [UTKFace](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) (aligned and cropped faces) dataset. It has also been uploaded in this repository. 

The model used was a **combination of two DCNN in TensorFlow 2**. 

Test output by trained model -
